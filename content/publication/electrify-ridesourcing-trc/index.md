abstract: This study examines regulatory policies for electrifying a ridesourcing system. To do so, we develop an aggregate modeling framework to analyze a ridesourcing market involving electric vehicles and examine the response of the ridesourcing platform to regulatory policies such as annual permit fees (AP), differential trip-based fees (TB) or differential commission caps (CC). Our modeling exercises and numerical analyses suggest that both AP and TB are effective at achieving a high electrification level, while CC may only electrify the system to a low level. However, CC is the most cost-efficient as it simultaneously benefits drivers and customers, and allows finer intervention to the market. TB is the least cost-efficient as the platform prefers to deliver fewer customers to avoid the trip-based fees and surcharge drivers and customers for higher per-trip profits. Under all policies, the platformâ€™s best response is always to adopt fast chargers and gradually expand the charging network to accommodate the increasing charging needs of its electric vehicle fleet.
